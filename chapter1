Why numpy is fast?

An array is a collection of homogeneous data-types which are stored in contagious memory locations, on the other hand, a list in Python is collection of heterogeneous data types stored in non-contagious memory locations.
The NumPy package breakdowns a task into multiple fragments, and then processes all the fragments parallelly.
The NumPy package integrates C, C++ and Fortran codes in Python, these programming languages have very less execution time as compared to python.
